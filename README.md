Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. Skin diseases may be caused by fungal infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. The advancement of lasers and Photonics based medical technology has made it possible to diagnose the skin diseases much more quickly and accurately. But the cost of such diagnosis is still limited and very expensive. So, image processing techniques help to build automated screening system for dermatology at an initial stage.. Computer vision has a role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. We proposed an image processing-based method to detect skin diseases. This method takes the digital image of disease effect skin area, then use image analysis to identify the type of disease.
